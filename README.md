## Requirements
Convert between currencies with live and real values. It also allows fictionary currencies to be created.

## :floppy_disk: Cloning and Installing
```
git clone https://github.com/debora-rebelatto/challenge-bravo
cd challenge-bravo
npm install
```

## :electric_plug: Connecting to Database

## :cd: Starting
To run the NodeJS application, run this in the terminal:

```
node src/server.js
```

But, reloading the terminal every time you make an update can be tiring so we can use nodemon to automatically restart the app. Install it globally:
```
npm i -g nodemon
```

and run this command to start the server
```
nodemon
```

## :whale2: Docker
### Build Image
```
docker build -t hurb-app .
```

Your image will now be listed by Docker:

```bash
docker images
```
Start the container and expose port 8000 to port 8000 on the host.

```bash
docker run --publish 8000:8000 hurb-app
```

## :running: Running Tests
### Unit Testing
To run tests, run the following command

```bash
npm run test
```

### Stress Tests
First, install the artillery package globally:
```bash
npm i -g artillery
```

Then run this at the command line:
```bash
artillery run load-test.yml
```

## :mailbox_closed: Postman
Using Postman, create a new collection and import the `hurb-bravo.json` file avaliable at the `docs` folder to import the requests used during development.
